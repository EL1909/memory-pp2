## Memory Game

This project is made to accomplish the 2nd milestone project for Code Institute.

For this assesment i will create a memory game, in wich the player can select between popular paintings from renamed artists, and once a pair is found, there will pop up a message stating the author and nae of the piece.

In order to accomplish this project, i will use HTML and CSS to create the grid and give it a proper styling. For functionability i will use Java Script.
